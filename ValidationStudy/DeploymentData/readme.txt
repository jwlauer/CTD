Files in this folder are data log files for deployment of sensors at North Winds Weir site from April 1 to April 5, 2021. Sensors were co-located
in the pool on the right bank at about -0.15 m MLLW for April 1-2, 3-4, and 4-5.  For April 2-3, sonde was located in main river at same elevation 
at entrance to pool, SU1 was located in pool about 1m depth, SU5 was on bank at mount of tidal channel, SU3 was in tidal channel on flat, and SU2 was 
in main river at footbridge at about 1 m depth.
  
The file datalogCTD_su4_processed.txt converts the time recorded by the Pico2040 to a real date/time.  There was a roughly 5 minute offset by the 
end of the deployment, so the time error was distributed into points proportional to the time the device had been on.  This results in both the
start date/time and the stop date/time matching the notes in the field book.
