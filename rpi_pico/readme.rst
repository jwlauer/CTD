This folder includes the files necessary to use a Raspberry Pi Pico 2040 as the microcontroller in the CTD. Note that as of MicroPython v1.14 2021-02-27, power saving features are not enabled, so current use is high. Modifications may be required in main.py once the pico power saving features are enabled.
