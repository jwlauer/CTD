This folder includes the files necessary to use a Raspberry Pi Pico 2040 as the microcontroller in the CTD. Note that as of MicroPython v1.14 2021-02-27, power saving features are not enabled, so current use is relatively high (current on the order of 20-30 mA).  This is reduced in the code by reducing the processor frequency to a value that is as low as possible while waiting reducing current to about 4.5 mA on a Pico 2040.  Testing shows current is one or two mA higher on Adafruit 2040 boards. Modifications may be required in main.py once the pico 2040 power saving features are enabled in MicroPython.
